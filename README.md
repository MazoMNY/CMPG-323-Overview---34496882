## Project Structure for the semester
### Repositories and projects information
For my projects i have created 5 different repositories in which all the projects tasks have been done, respectively the:
- _**CMPG-323 - Overview**_ repository for project 1 [https://github.com/MazoMNY/CMPG-323-Overview---34496882-]
- _**CMPG 323 - Project 2**_ repository for project 2 [https://github.com/MazoMNY/CMPG-323-Project-2---34496882]
- _**CMPG 323 - Project 3**_ repository for project 3 [https://github.com/MazoMNY/CMPG-323-Project-3---34496882]
- _**CMPG 323 Project 4**_ repository for project 4 [https://github.com/MazoMNY/CMPG323-Project4-34496882]
- _**CMPG 323 Project 5**_ repository for project 5 [https://github.com/MazoMNY/CMPG-323-Project-5-34496882]

All of these 5 projects have checked the project requirements for the _**Portfolio of Evidence submission**_. Each _ReadMe_ file for each repository has been updated accordingly. Please follow the links attached above for easy access.

### Branching Strategy
For my projects, i used the _**GitHub Flow**_ branching strategy. In this strategy, i was merging all my different 'work'/code into the _main_ branch. All the new work under each repository was commited to the _main_ branch. An exception was with project 3. I had to create a different branch called _develop_. All the new work was commited to this branch instead of the _"main"_ branch. 

### .gitignore file use for each project & Storage of credentials and sensitive information

For each project, the _.gitignore_ file was used to store all the other files created by other processes. This includes all _operating system files, application files and file downloads with package managers_. An example for an operating system file includes Thumbs.db (Windows), which is used for display purposes. For the application files, i will store in the _.gitignore_ file all files generated by code editors. Lastly, since files that are downloaded with package managers can be re-downloaded quickly by running one command, i also included these in the _.gitignore_ file for each project. 

To prevent the mistake of leaving secrets on the GitHub repository, the use of _gitignore_ files was an option. Credentials includes username and passwords.

A file such as **_"wp-config.php"_** could have username and passwords to databases. Therefore, the storage of sensitive information on github is not advised, for mistakes as such could allow an attacker to capture all the passwords and have access to all the secrets on the repository. This could lead to a security disaster. I will also enable MFA for my GitHub account.
