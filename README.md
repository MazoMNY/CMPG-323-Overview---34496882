## Project Structure for the semester
### Repositories and projects information
For my projects i have concluded that the use of one repository, respectively the _**CMPG-323-Overview**_ repository, will make all my submissions easier. Therefore, this means that i will create and link 5 different projects to this repository. All of these 5 projects will check the project requirements for the _**Portfolio of Evidence submission**_.
