### Repositories and projects information
For my projects i will create 5 different repositories in which all the projects tasks will be done, respectively the:
- _**CMPG-323 - Overview**_ repository for _project 1_
- _**CMPG 323 - Project 2**_ repository for project 2
- _**CMPG 323 - Project 3**_ repository for project 3
- _**CMPG 323 Project 4**_ repository for project 4
- _**CMPG 323 Project 5**_ repository for project 5

All of these 5 projects will check the project requirements for the _**Portfolio of Evidence submission**_. 

### Repository to Projects Diagram explaination


### Branching Strategy
For my projects, i will be using the _**GitHub Flow**_ branching strategy. In this strategy, i will be merging all my different 'work'/code into the _master_ branch. Each time i work on something new, i will create a branch off from _master_ and give it a descriptive name. I will consistently push my work to the same named branch on the server after commiting to the branch created. I will then open a _pull request_ each time i am ready to merge to the master branch. 

### .gitignore file use for each project
### Storage of credentials and sensitive information
### Reference List for Project 1
